    <p>I have always loved dogs and have hada few different breeds as I have grown from a 
        child to an adult. Growing up my parents rescued a long-haired beagle puppy 
        (genetic deformity, therefore planned to be euthanized) from a animal testing lab. 
        He lived for 12 years and then a few years later we got a Black Labrador. She was a 
        sweet and intelligent dog. We had her only  6 months before we tragically lost her 
        to a car accident on Christmas night. We were all devastated and did not pursue 
        owning another dog. After beinng married 5 years, having 3 children and moving to a 
        house with 3 acres of woodlands, we decided to rescue a black and tan coonhound from 
        the local shelter. Two more resues followed, and after losing the 1st and 3rd dog, 
        in 2019 we bought <a href="../Images/IMG_0037.jpg">Lilah.</a>
    </p>
    <p>Lilah is a Vizsla. I had not heard of the breed before, but as I researched about 
        their fierce loyalty to their owners, needing to always be near and preferably in 
        contact with them, I knew it was the breed for me. Our children are grown and we have 
        two grandchildren and three vizlsas. Lilah is currently 5 years old and she was joined 
        by Charlie in 2023. With breeding as a long term goal, I started showing Charlie in AKC 
        conformation shows. Above is our picture at the 2023 National Dog Show where he won his 
        first major. He is halfway to earning his champion title. In February, I had the 
        opportunity to help whelp a Vizsla litter and then unexpectedly adopted one of those 
        pups. His name is Micah, pictured below.
